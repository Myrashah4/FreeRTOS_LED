# FreeRTOS_LED
This code will help us understand the usage of FreeRTOS with an stm microcontroller board using STMCube IDE.

To use this code just select your board and then find the src and go to your main.c file.

This code will help us understand what more we can do with the LEDs on our board, How we can control them, how we can use the HAL functions and different FreeRTOS libraries and establish a connection between our device and our board.

I have use PUTTY serial to look at the results at baud rate 115200. Also force on the differnt properties like command line editing.
